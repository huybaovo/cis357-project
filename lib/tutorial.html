        <h3>Project Description</h3>
        <p>Decribe project here</p>

        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p> Description of the platform focus area you studied as well as the demo app your reader will be implementing as they follow your tutorial.  Use screenshots and/or video clips liberally to help your reader understand the proposed functionality of the demo app. 
        </p>

        <h4>Getting started</h4>
        <p>Describe the software development environment, the reader will need on his/her machine to complete your tutorial, including things like IDE version, dependencies, and jump off links on where to download, install tutorials, etc. 
        </p>
        
        <h4>Step-by-step coding instructions</h4>
        <p>This could be subdivided into multiple sections as you see fit, but basically this will be the “meat” of your tutorial.  It will consist of code snippets, text discussing the code, figures / videos of perhaps concepts that are hard to describe in text / code.  Make sure any code snippets are formatted well and readable.  Readers should also be able to copy/paste code snippets in your tutorial if they are attempting to follow along in their code editor as they read. 
        </p>
        
        <h4>Conclusion/Discussion</h4>
        <p>Summary of your tutorial, including any other alternative approaches developers might pursue to implement the same functionality (e.g. third party components that can be used in lieu of the native features you have studied) related platform features the reader might want to refer to for further study, as well as a link to a github repo of your complete source code.
        </p>

        <h4>See Also Section</h4>
        <p>In this final section of your tutorial, provide a list of references (with hyperlinks) to similar or related tutorials, particularly those tutorials that you found helpful in learning about your topic and preparing your own demo and code tutorial.
